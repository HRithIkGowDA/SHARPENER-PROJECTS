1) a b d (after timout) c 

 REASON = pretty obvious answer , first 2 lines get executed later callback function gets executed and program waits for 1sec and c gets executed



2) a b d c 

REASON - no timeout direct execution



3)a b d c e 

REASON - abd executes first since no timeeout next c because 0 timeout later e since it has 1 sec to wait





//*******SPREAD OPERATOR


The spread operator (...) is a JavaScript operator that allows an iterable (such as an array or object) to be expanded in places where zero or more elements (for arrays) or properties (for objects) are expected.

let obj1 = {a: 1, b: 2};

let obj2 = {c: 3, d: 4};

let mergedObject = {...obj1, ...obj2};

console.log(mergedObject); // Output: {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4}



let array1 = [1, 2];

let array2 = [3, 4];

let mergedArray = [...array1, ...array2];

console.log(mergedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]













4) 

let studentobj = {'yash': 26,'vaibhav': 24,'rajesh' : 25};

let sum = 0;

let count = 0;

for (const student in studentobj) {

  sum += studentobj[student];

  count++;

}

let averageAge = sum/count;

console.log('Average age:', averageAge);









5)function findAverageAge(studentobj) {

  let sum = 0;

  let count = 0;

  for (const student in studentobj) {

    sum += studentobj[student];

    count++;

  }

  return sum/count;

}



let studentobj = {'yash': 26,'vaibhav': 24,'rajesh' : 25};

console.log(findAverageAge(studentobj));
